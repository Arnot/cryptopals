* TODO Move malloc/calloc from callee to caller
Currently callees allocate a result-buffer and callers ~free()~ these blocks.
This sucks for situations where buffers could be reused.
* TODO Split cryptopals.h into separate headers
* TODO Cleanup base64-tools
- Generate char buffer instead of printing groups of 3 characters

* Document blocks-array in challenge 6
~blocks~ is a 2-dimensional array of ~num_blocks~ arrays containing ~blocksize~
or ~keysize~ bytes
